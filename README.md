# 👋 Hi, I'm Saif

🎓 I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at BME (Budapest), originally from Jordan.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **mechanical design, automation, control systems, robotics, and computational engineering**.

## 🔧 What I Do
- Design and simulate **mechanical systems** (CAD, FEA, CFD)  
- Develop and test **control systems**: PID, state-space, nonlinear models  
- Build **automation and robotics projects** with Python, MATLAB, and embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers)  
- Model and optimize **thermal–fluid processes** (boilers, pumps, fuel cells, HVAC systems)  
- Explore **software engineering for engineers**: simulation apps, UI tools, and web apps  

## 🧠 Areas of Focus
- Mechanical & thermal–fluid systems  
- Control, robotics, and mechatronics  
- Industrial automation, PLCs, and smart manufacturing  
- Computational tools (Python, MATLAB/Simulink, Ansys, SolidWorks, OpenFOAM)  
- Open-source projects and cross-disciplinary engineering applications  

## 🌱 Always Learning
- Advanced CFD and multiphysics simulations  
- PLC programming (TIA Portal, Ladder Logic) and SCADA systems  
- AI/ML for optimization and smart control  
- Best practices in software development, documentation, and collaboration  

## 📍 Location
Based in Budapest 🇭🇺 | From Jordan 🇯🇴
